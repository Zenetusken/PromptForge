## In Progress
- None (session ending)

## Next Up (for next coding agent)
Priority: Work on T0 tests first (IDs 1-14), then T1 (IDs 15-45)

The backend is largely functional with mock data. Key work needed:
1. ID 1: Backend server starts on port 8000 — SHOULD PASS (init.sh starts it)
2. ID 2: Frontend dev server starts on port 5173 — SHOULD PASS (init.sh starts it)
3. ID 3: Health endpoint returns OK — SHOULD PASS (already verified)
4. ID 4: Database auto-creates on startup — SHOULD PASS (lifespan handler)
5. ID 5: Frontend serves index page — SHOULD PASS (SvelteKit serves it)
6. ID 9: Frontend loads cyberpunk CSS — Check that the theme renders correctly
7. ID 10: Root layout structure renders — Check sidebar + main area
8. ID 12: Frontend can reach backend API — Check CORS works in browser
9. ID 14: Header component renders — Check "PromptForge" text visible

After T0, focus on T1 (API endpoint correctness):
- The SSE optimize endpoint creates records but currently uses mock data
  and doesn't update the DB record after streaming. The record is created
  at stream start but fields like optimized_prompt stay null. This needs
  fixing for tests 28-40 to pass.
- The optimize endpoint needs to update the DB record with full pipeline
  results after the SSE stream completes.

## Validation Report — Session 2 (Validator Agent)

**Scope:** Quick validation — 0 previously passing tests, focused on infrastructure health
**Infrastructure:** Fixed (2 critical issues found and resolved)

**Infrastructure issues found and fixed:**
1. Backend crash on startup — `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`
   - Root cause: `.env` file set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/promptforge.db` (relative path).
     When uvicorn starts from `backend/` directory, this resolved to `backend/data/` which doesn't exist.
     The `config.py` already had a correct absolute path as default, but `.env` was overriding it.
   - Fix: Removed `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` and `.env.example` so config.py's absolute path default is used.

2. Frontend SSR crash — `rune_outside_svelte: The $state rune is only available inside .svelte and .svelte.js/ts files`
   - Root cause: Store files `history.ts` and `optimization.ts` used `$state()` runes but had `.ts` extension.
     Svelte 5 runes require `.svelte.ts` file extension.
   - Fix: Renamed `history.ts` → `history.svelte.ts`, `optimization.ts` → `optimization.svelte.ts`.
     Updated all 5 import paths in components (HistorySidebar, +page, Toast, PipelineStep, PipelineProgress).

**Regressions found:** 0 (no previously passing tests to regress)
**Tests still passing after validation:** 0/200

**Tier breakdown:**
- T0: 0/14 passing
- T1: 0/31 passing
- T2: 0/75 passing
- T3: 0/40 passing
- T4: 0/25 passing
- T5: 0/15 passing

**Post-fix verification:**
- Backend health: `{"status":"ok","db_connected":true,"version":"0.1.0"}` ✅
- Frontend loads: HTTP 200, cyberpunk UI renders correctly ✅
- Frontend build: Succeeds without errors ✅
- Database: `optimizations` table created with 25 columns ✅
- Frontend→Backend API: Vite proxy working, fetch to /api/health succeeds ✅
- No console errors in browser ✅
- No SSR errors in frontend logs ✅

**Guidance for next coding session:**
- Infrastructure is now healthy — both servers start and stay running
- Begin working on T0 tests (IDs 1-14). Most should be ready to pass now:
  - IDs 1-5: Server startup, health, DB, frontend serve — all verified working
  - ID 6: CORS — verified working (frontend can fetch /api/health)
  - ID 9: Cyberpunk CSS — verified rendering in screenshot
  - ID 10: Layout structure — sidebar + main area visible
  - ID 12: Frontend→Backend API connectivity — verified
  - ID 14: Header component — "PromptForge" text visible
- After marking T0 tests as passing, move to T1 (IDs 15-45)
- Key T1 blocker: optimize endpoint creates DB record but doesn't update after streaming
- Store files are now `.svelte.ts` — always use this extension for files with runes

**Progress:** 0/200 tests passing (0%)
**Server info:** Backend on :8000, Frontend on :5173, start with ./init.sh

## Known Issues
1. optimize endpoint creates initial DB record but doesn't fully update it
   after streaming completes — the SSE events contain correct mock data
   but the DB record has null fields for optimized_prompt, scores, etc.
   Fix: Update the DB record at the end of the SSE generator.
2. Backend uses mock data (not real Claude API calls) — this is intentional
   for T0/T1 testing. Real claude-agent-sdk integration comes in T2.
3. Frontend build shows adapter-auto warning about production environment —
   cosmetic, doesn't affect dev mode.
4. The `pkill` command has sandbox restrictions — use init.sh to manage
   server lifecycle instead of manual process management.

## Server Info
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/api/health
- Start everything: ./init.sh
- Backend runs from: backend/ directory with venv activated
- Frontend runs from: frontend/ directory with npm run dev

## Architecture Notes
- Backend CWD should be set to backend/ before starting uvicorn
- Frontend vite.config.ts proxies /api/* to http://localhost:8000
- Database file: data/promptforge.db (auto-created on first start)
- Scores are stored as floats 0.0-1.0 in the DB (multiply by 10 for display)
